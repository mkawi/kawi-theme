## Preview Preferences

I haven't included a font in this release as I know that it's a very personal preference.

The font in the preview image is JetBrains Mono, [available here](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/). Editor settings to activate font ligatures:

```
"editor.fontFamily": "JetBrains Mono",
"editor.fontLigatures": true,
```

The preview image is using [Bracket Pair Colorizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer), a really cool extension that highlights matching brackets. This can help reduce unwanted errors.

I use this setting:

```
"bracketPairColorizer.forceIterationColorCycle": true,
```

## Contribute

First, this theme is new so if there are any problems, please open an issue. There are many languages and parts of VS Code I don't use, so let me know!

If you would like to change something, you can either open an Issue/Pull Request and see if I'd like it added, or override the colours in your own settings.json file.

If you are making a Pull Request, Please include a screenshot of before & after!

- The token colorization is done based on standard TextMate themes. Colors are matched against one or more scopes.

To learn more about scopes and how they're used, check out the [color theme](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/color-theme) documentation.

## Future Plans

- Release light versions of the theme, regular and italic.
- Recreate versions for other code editors (Atom, Sublime Text, Notepad++, etc.)
